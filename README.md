--------------------------------------
To build a multi-class classification model that predicts cryptocurrency behavior based on historical data, we can follow a series of steps, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, training, and evaluation. Here is an outline of how to approach this project in Python, using popular machine learning libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, and xgboost (for a gradient boosting model, which is often very effective for structured/tabular data).
Steps:

    Data Preprocessing:
        Load the data (typically in CSV or similar format).
        Handle missing values (imputation or removal).
        Feature scaling (e.g., standardization or normalization).
        Split the data into training and testing sets.

    Model Selection:
        Since this is a multi-class classification problem, we'll test a few models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.).

    Model Training:
        Train the model using the training data.

    Model Evaluation:
        Evaluate the model using cross-validation and metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. We need to achieve at least 90% accuracy, but precision and recall will be the combined metric for success.

    Hyperparameter Tuning:
        Use Grid Search or Random Search to optimize hyperparameters for the chosen model.

Here's an example Python code to get you started:
1. Import Necessary Libraries

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, GridSearchCV
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, accuracy_score
from xgboost import XGBClassifier
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import precision_score, recall_score

2. Load and Explore the Data

Since the dataset is not provided, this is a placeholder for loading the data. Let's assume the dataset is a CSV file.

# Load the dataset (replace with the actual file path)
df = pd.read_csv('path_to_your_data.csv')

# Check the first few rows of the dataset
print(df.head())

# Get some basic information
print(df.info())

3. Preprocess the Data

    Handle missing values (impute or drop rows/columns if needed).
    Feature scaling (normalize/standardize numerical features).

# Drop columns that are not relevant (e.g., ID columns if they exist)
df = df.drop(columns=['id'])

# Handle missing values (e.g., imputation with the mean)
df.fillna(df.mean(), inplace=True)

# Separate features and the target variable (assuming 'target' is the column with the labels)
X = df.drop(columns=['target'])
y = df['target']

# Feature scaling: Standardize the features (important for models like Logistic Regression)
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# Split the data into training and test sets (80% train, 20% test)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_scaled, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

4. Model Selection

Now, we can define different models and test them. We'll evaluate three common models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
4.1 Logistic Regression

# Initialize and train the Logistic Regression model
log_reg = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000, random_state=42)
log_reg.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predictions
y_pred_log_reg = log_reg.predict(X_test)

# Evaluation
print("Logistic Regression:")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred_log_reg))

4.2 Random Forest Classifier

# Initialize and train the Random Forest Classifier model
rf_classifier = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)
rf_classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predictions
y_pred_rf = rf_classifier.predict(X_test)

# Evaluation
print("Random Forest Classifier:")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred_rf))

4.3 XGBoost Classifier

# Initialize and train the XGBoost model
xgb_classifier = XGBClassifier(random_state=42, use_label_encoder=False, eval_metric='mlogloss')
xgb_classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predictions
y_pred_xgb = xgb_classifier.predict(X_test)

# Evaluation
print("XGBoost Classifier:")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred_xgb))

5. Model Evaluation

In order to evaluate the model performance, we focus on precision, recall, and accuracy. The classification_report function from sklearn provides all the key metrics.

To evaluate performance based on the combined metric of precision and recall, we will focus on the F1-score, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.

# Function to calculate combined precision and recall (F1-score)
def evaluate_model(y_test, y_pred):
    print("Precision:", precision_score(y_test, y_pred, average='weighted'))
    print("Recall:", recall_score(y_test, y_pred, average='weighted'))
    print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
    print("F1 Score:", (2 * precision_score(y_test, y_pred, average='weighted') * recall_score(y_test, y_pred, average='weighted')) / 
          (precision_score(y_test, y_pred, average='weighted') + recall_score(y_test, y_pred, average='weighted')))
    print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

# Evaluate XGBoost (as a strong candidate)
evaluate_model(y_test, y_pred_xgb)

6. Hyperparameter Tuning (Optional)

To improve the model, we can use Grid Search or Random Search for hyperparameter tuning. Here’s an example using GridSearchCV for XGBoost:

# Define the parameter grid for XGBoost
param_grid = {
    'max_depth': [3, 6, 10],
    'learning_rate': [0.01, 0.05, 0.1],
    'n_estimators': [50, 100, 200],
    'subsample': [0.8, 1.0]
}

# Grid Search Cross-validation
grid_search = GridSearchCV(estimator=XGBClassifier(random_state=42, use_label_encoder=False, eval_metric='mlogloss'),
                           param_grid=param_grid,
                           scoring='accuracy', cv=3, verbose=2, n_jobs=-1)

grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Best parameters and best score
print("Best parameters:", grid_search.best_params_)
print("Best cross-validation score:", grid_search.best_score_)

# Evaluate the best model on the test data
best_model = grid_search.best_estimator_
y_pred_best = best_model.predict(X_test)
evaluate_model(y_test, y_pred_best)

7. Final Model

Once you've tuned your model and achieved the desired accuracy (at least 90%), you can save the model for future use.

import joblib

# Save the model to disk
joblib.dump(best_model, 'cryptocurrency_predictor_model.pkl')

# Save the scaler as well
joblib.dump(scaler, 'scaler.pkl')

Summary:

    Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, scale features, and split data.
    Model Selection: Test multiple models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
    Evaluation: Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
    Hyperparameter Tuning: Use GridSearchCV to optimize model parameters.
    Deployment: Save the final model for production use.

Once you've achieved the required performance (90% accuracy), you can submit your solution for review.
==================
It sounds like a fascinating challenge, and I'd be excited to help you build a model to predict cryptocurrency behavior. Based on the information you shared, here’s a high-level outline of how we can approach the project:
Steps for Building the Multi-Class Classification Model:

    Data Preprocessing:
        Load and Inspect Data: First, we’ll load the dataset and perform an initial inspection to understand the structure of the features and target variable (deviation).
        Feature Engineering: Since there are 240 features, we need to explore the relationships between them and remove any irrelevant or highly correlated ones. Normalization or standardization might be necessary for certain models (especially if you’re using algorithms sensitive to scale, such as SVM or KNN).
        Handle Missing Values: Missing data will be imputed or removed based on the severity of the issue. If features have missing values, we could use techniques like mean imputation or median imputation, or we could drop those features if necessary.
        Label Encoding: Since it's a multi-class classification, the target variable (deviation) will need to be encoded using LabelEncoder if it’s categorical or OneHotEncoding if needed.

    Model Selection:
        Baseline Model: We can start by training a baseline model (like Logistic Regression or Random Forest) to see if the data is separable with simple classifiers.
        Advanced Models: Since we're aiming for high accuracy, we'll likely try more sophisticated algorithms like:
            Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM): XGBoost, LightGBM, or CatBoost, which often perform well on structured/tabular data.
            Neural Networks: If the dataset size and complexity justify it, a deep learning approach might be worth exploring using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).
        Cross-Validation: We'll use cross-validation (like k-fold cross-validation) to avoid overfitting and ensure the model generalizes well on unseen data.

    Performance Evaluation:
        Precision, Recall, and F1-Score: To meet the accuracy requirements, we'll focus on a balanced evaluation using precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics are important when dealing with imbalanced classes, which is common in many real-world classification tasks.
        Confusion Matrix: We'll also generate a confusion matrix to analyze the performance across different classes and help identify which class predictions need improvement.

    Hyperparameter Tuning:
        Grid Search or Randomized Search: We will fine-tune the model hyperparameters using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to get the best possible combination for accuracy.
        Early Stopping: For models like gradient boosting or neural networks, we'll implement early stopping to prevent overfitting and speed up training.

    Model Interpretation:
        Feature Importance: Using feature importance (for tree-based models like XGBoost) or SHAP values, we can identify the most influential features in predicting cryptocurrency behavior.
        Model Explainability: If needed, we’ll implement techniques like LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) to help explain the model’s predictions, especially if it needs to be deployed in production with a need for transparency.

Example Code Outline:

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, cross_val_score, GridSearchCV
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
import xgboost as xgb

# Step 1: Load and inspect the data
data = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')

# Step 2: Data Preprocessing
# Encode the target variable if needed (assuming 'deviation' is the target)
encoder = LabelEncoder()
data['target'] = encoder.fit_transform(data['deviation'])

# Separate features and target
X = data.drop(columns=['deviation', 'target'])
y = data['target']

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Step 3: Train the model (e.g., XGBoost)
model = xgb.XGBClassifier(objective='multi:softmax', num_class=3)  # Adjust num_class as needed
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Step 4: Evaluate the model
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

# Optionally, use hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV) to improve the model
param_grid = {
    'max_depth': [3, 6, 9],
    'learning_rate': [0.01, 0.1, 0.2],
    'n_estimators': [100, 500]
}
grid_search = GridSearchCV(model, param_grid, cv=3, scoring='accuracy')
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Best model evaluation
y_pred_best = grid_search.best_estimator_.predict(X_test)
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred_best))

# Feature importance
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
xgb.plot_importance(grid_search.best_estimator_)
plt.show()

Key Points:

    Data Loading and Preprocessing: Load the transformed dataset, encode the target variable, and split it for training/testing.
    Model Training: Train using XGBoost, but you can try other models as needed.
    Evaluation: We are focusing on precision, recall, and the F1-score for the final evaluation, alongside a confusion matrix.
    Hyperparameter Tuning: Use grid search for tuning and improving the model’s performance.

Next Steps:

    Once you share the dataset, Further with loading, training, and optimizing the model.
    If you need help with data interpretation or specific algorithms, we can refine the approach accordingly.
